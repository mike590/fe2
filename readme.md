Plan:

move carousel from top to bottom based on device size
style everything
images have the path '.app' prefixed to them. Abstract it to env variable

Ideas:
Does carousel have arrows on either side to rotate through? Or can it be done by hovering to one side?
Highlight shows in the carousel as you hover over them in the carousel
Info bubbles (like tooltips) when hovering for multiple seconds over a show in the carousel
Spice up the bg?
Maybe add arrows to the sides of the FocusedComponent, to allow moving through the carousel form there
upon shrinking the screen, have the focusedShowComponent slide up instead of teleport
