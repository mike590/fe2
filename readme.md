Plan:

unit tests
images have the path '.app' prefixed to them. Abstract it to env variable
split dependencies into deps and dev-deps
change simplest components to functions

Ideas:
Fix the styling for landscape mode in phone
Make unselected shows in carousel slightly transparent?
Arrows on side of carousel?
e2e tests
Highlight/scale shows in the carousel as you hover over them in the carousel
Spice up the bg?
FocusedComponent should slide up and down when carousel repositions, not teleport
Load only visible assets first (detect based on id), then the rest, scheduled loading
when navigating to a show, highlight it and bring it to center or left side of carousel
