Plan:

3-4 Components:

ContainerComponent is top level, contains FocusedComponent and CarouselComponent
FocusedComponent (presentation comp)
CarouselComponent (presentation comp)
***MAYBE*** each show in the carousel is a SlotComponent

Ideas:
Does carousel have arrows on either side to rotate through? Or can it be done by hovering to one side?
Highlight shows in the carousel as you hover over them in the carousel
Info bubbles (like tooltips) when hovering for multiple seconds over a show in the carousel
Spice of the bg?
