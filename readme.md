Plan:

style everything
make it so nav border doesnt go across whole screen
unit tests
images have the path '.app' prefixed to them. Abstract it to env variable
change simplest components to functions
split dependencies into deps and dev-deps

Ideas:
Make unselected shows in carousel slightly transparent?
Does carousel have arrows on either side to rotate through? Or can it be done by hovering to one side?
e2e tests
Highlight shows in the carousel as you hover over them in the carousel
Info bubbles (like tooltips) when hovering for multiple seconds over a show in the carousel
Spice up the bg?
FocusedComponent should slide up and down when carousel repositions, not teleport
Load only visible assets first (detect based on id), then the rest, scheduled loading
when navigating to a show, highlight it and bring it to center or left side of carousel
